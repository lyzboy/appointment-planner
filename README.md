# Appointment Planner

## Overview

This application is designed to manage contacts and appointments efficiently, leveraging the power of functional React components. It features two main pages: one dedicated to viewing and adding contacts, and another for managing appointments. Utilizing stateful and stateless functional React components alongside hooks, the app offers a seamless user experience for scheduling and organizing.

## Features

-   **Contact Management:** A page dedicated to viewing and adding new contacts, allowing users to keep track of personal or professional connections.
-   **Appointment Scheduling:** A separate page for viewing and adding appointments, facilitating the organization of meetings or events with ease.
-   **Functional React Components:** The application is built using functional React components, employing hooks for state management to ensure efficient performance and reusability.
-   **Stateful and Stateless Components:** By distinguishing between stateful and stateless components, the app optimizes rendering and state management, contributing to a smoother user interface and user experience.

## Implementation

The app's architecture encourages the use of both stateful and stateless functional React components, with hooks being a central aspect of state management. The development process is flexible, allowing for implementation in any order that suits the developer's comfort and preference.
